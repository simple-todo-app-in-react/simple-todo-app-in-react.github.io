        <h2>Todo App</h2>

        <p>
          In this blog post, I will show you how to create a To-do app in React
          with the concepts that I showed from the first blog post (Add the
          first blog1 link here) as well as new concepts that will be explained
          later on.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this To-do app, you will be able to create, display, update, and
          delete todo items. These features will use the “useState()” hook to
          keep track of changes to the todo list. There will also be dynamic
          styles used based on whether a todo item is done or not done.
        </p>
        <p>
          While writing the different features of the todo app, there will be
          multiple components created for better readability instead of creating
          just a single component (App component) with everything inside of it.
        </p>
        <p>New concepts that will be learned:</p>
        <p>🔹 Using the map function on an array to display items</p>

        <p>🔹 Using a form in React and handling the form submit</p>

        <p>🔹 Adding a new item to an array state variable</p>

        <p>🔹 Modifying an item in an array state variable</p>

        <p>🔹 Deleting an item in an array state variable</p>
        <p>
          These concepts will be explained in this blog post as you read
          through.
        </p>
        <h1>Part 1: Using create-react-app to setup the app</h1>
        <p>
          1. Create the react app by opening a terminal an entering this
          command:
        </p>
        <p>npx create-react-app todo-list</p>
        <p>
          2. Open the folder “todo-list” in your code editor (e.g. in VS Code)
        </p>
        <p>
          3. To start running the app, open a terminal and run this command:
        </p>
        <p>npm start</p>
        <h1>Part 2: Adding basic styling</h1>
        <p>
          We will add basic styling so that our app displays the todo items in a
          simple and friendly way.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Open App.css and change the contents to the css below. This styling
          is basic styling used for creating a background for the app, and
          styling for each todo item:

          <img class="example" src="./AppCss.png" />
        </p>
        <h1>Part 3: Showing To-Do Items</h1>
        <p>
          5. Open App.jsx and change the contents to the following code below.
        </p>
        <img class="example" src="./App1.png" />

        <p>
          This code creates a state variable called “todos” that will store the
          data for all the todo items in an array. In the useState there are
          three todo items which are being used as fake data so that we can
          start showing todo items.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember from the first blog post, that “useState()” will remember its
          current value when rendering for achieving an interactive user
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, this is what the app will look like in the browser, no todo
          items displayed yet!
          <img class="example" src="./Result1.png" />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          6. Use the map() function with the “todos” array to display the todo
          items
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>New concept</b>: Using the map function on an array to display
          items
        </p>
        <p>
          In React, one way to show multiple items from an array in the app is
          to use the “map()” function. See this example and then see the
          explanation below
          <img class="example" src="./ConceptMapExample.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          • First of all, the example above creates an array called “data” with
          the useState() hook and that array contains items with objects like “{
          id: …, name: “...”, role: “...”}”
        </p>
        <p>
          • Then, on line 11, the “map()” function is used on the “data” array
          with an arrow function inside the round brackets like: “(emp) =&gt;
          (…)”
        </p>
        <p>
          • The map() function will loop through each item in the “data” array
          and call the arrow function each time. The result for each item is
          inside the round brackets after =&gt; which is “&lt;div&gt; …
          &lt;/div&gt;”
        </p>
        <p>
          • “emp” is a parameter for an item from the “data” array. The name can
          be changed to whatever you want. For example, the first time the map()
          function loops, emp will be the value “{ id: 10, name: “Alex”, role:
          “Developer” }”
        </p>
        <p>
          • To show data from the “emp” parameter, use curly brackets
          “{emp.fieldName}” like in the example “{emp.name}” and “{emp.role}”
        </p>
        <img class="example" src="./ConceptMapResult.png" />

        <p>
          <i>Back to the todo app…</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, update the code in the return ( … ) part of the App.jsx file:

          <img class="example" src="./App2.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          In this step, we used “todos.map((todo, index) =&gt; ( ... ))” to
          display each todo in the “todos” array by looping through each todo
          item to create a div with the todo text inside.
        </p>
        <p><b>New concept</b>: “key” attribute in components / JSX elements</p>
        <p>
          Also, we set “key={index}” because React requires that JSX elements
          that are directly inside of “map(...)” have a “key”. As a reminder,
          “JSX elements” include tags like “&lt;div&gt;” or components like
          “&lt;Component /&gt;”. React uses the “key” to correctly update the
          app when items are moved around, inserted, or deleted. The key should
          be unique for an element, such as a unique “id” in data. In our todo
          app, our todos do not have an id, so we used the index as the key.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app should look like this now:
          <img class="example" src="./Result2.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Splitting up the code: We can make the App component smaller by
          creating a Todo component in a separate file and using it in the App
          component like “&lt;Todo … /&gt;”. See below for the changes to the
          code
        </p>
        <p>
          Making the code for each component smaller is helpful to understand
          each component more easily, without as many details to process at one
          time
        </p>
        <p>
          In new file Todo.jsx in src/ folder:
          <img class="example" src="./Todo1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          In App.jsx, import the new Todo component:
          <img class="example" src="./App3-import.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Then in App.jsx, use the Todo component in the map() function:
          <img class="example" src="./App3-return.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          This step will not change how the app is displayed in the browser, so
          let's move on to the next part.
        </p>

        <h1>Part 4: Adding To-Do Items</h1>

        <p>
          In this part, you will learn how to add new todo items in your app. To
          start out, you will learn about how to add items to an array that was
          created with “useState()”:
        </p>
        <p><b>New concept</b>: Adding a new item to an array state variable</p>
        <p>
          In React, state variables are set using the “setNAME()” function from
          the useState() line: “const [NAME, setNAME] = useState(…);”. However,
          to add an item to an array state variable, the original array must be
          copied, then the copied array can be modified. See the code and
          explanations below:

          <img class="example" src="./ConceptAddExample.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          • First of all, the example above creates an array called “data” with
          the useState() hook and that array contains items with objects like “{
          id: …, name: “...”, role: “...”}”
        </p>
        <p>
          • Then, on line 10, we defined an “onAddData” function where there is
          one parameter “newEmpData” which should have the data for an emp
          including “id”, “name”, and “role”.
        </p>
        <p>
          • On line 11, the original “data” array is copied using the spread
          operator (the dot-dot-dot …) inside of square brackets.
        </p>
        <p>
          • On line 12, we add the “newEmpData” object to the copied array
          “newData”
        </p>
        <p>
          • On line 13, we use “setData(...)” to update the data array so that
          the next time the app render it will show the list including the
          newest item.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Finally, you can see an example of calling the “onAddData” function
          which could be used when submitting a form to add a new employee.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. In the App.jsx file, we will add a function “onAddTodo” that will
          have a parameter “todoData” that will be added as a new todo item:

          <img class="example" src="./App4.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          9. We also will be creating a new component called AddTodoForm that
          will take input for a new todo item. This will use a &lt;form&gt;, so
          we will first learn about how to use form in React to handle form
          submitting:
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>New concept</b>: Using a form in React and handling the form submit
        </p>
        <p>
          In React, a &lt;form&gt; can be used to add new data to an app. There
          are several parts including handling onSubmit, preventDefault(), and
          controlling inputs that will be discussed below:
          <img class="exampleWide" src="./ConceptFormExample.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          • First of all, the example above creates an object called “empData”
          with the useState() hook with the fields “name” and “role”
        </p>
        <p>
          • Then, on line 6, we defined aa “handleSubmit” function where there
          is one parameter “e” for the event that called the “handleSubmit”
          function.
        </p>
        <p>
          • On line 7 we used “e.preventDefault()” to stop the browser from
          refreshing the page after submitting
        </p>
        <p>
          • On line 8, there is validation to make sure that the name and role
          are not empty.
        </p>
        <p>
          • On line 9, we print a message to the browser. This is where the new
          data could be added to a backend, or to an array of employees.
        </p>
        <p>
          • On line 10, the “empData” state variable is reset back to being
          empty
        </p>
        <p>
          • On lines 17 and 23, we are controlling the value of the inputs
          depending on the current values in empData. This is what lets us clear
          the inputs after the form is submitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          • On Lines 18 and 24, we are using the onChange attribute to update
          the name and role in the “empData” state variable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is the result after submitting:
          <img class="exampleShort" src="./ConceptFormResult.png" />
        </p>
        <p><i>Back to the todo app…</i></p>
        <p>
          9. <i>(continued)</i> This new component will also use “useState()” to
          keep track of what the user typed in and then will handle the form
          submit (e.g. when the user presses the "enter” key in the form, or
          when the submit button is clicked). It will also check that the “text”
          for the new todo item is not empty.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a new file "AddTodoForm.jsx" in src/ folder add the following code:
          <img class="exampleWide" src="./AddTodoForm1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, add this new AddTodoForm component to your App component and
          pass the onAddTodo function to the AddTodoForm component
        </p>
        <p>
          In App.jsx, import the new AddTodoForm component:
          <img class="exampleShort" src="./App5-import.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          In App.jsx, use the AddTodoForm component:
          <img class="exampleShort" src="./App5-return.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Open your application in a web browser. You should be able to see the
          original todo list items from the fake data and now a form at the top
          that allows you to add a new todo item:
          <img class="example" src="./Result3.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that you can create todo items, we will move on to being able to
          update items to being completed, and then showing them in a separate
          “completed” todo list.
        </p>

        <h1>Part 5 - Updating To-Do Items</h1>
        <p>
          10. It's time to allow completing items to move then to the
          “completed” section of the todo app. First, we will add more data to
          the todos array in the App component:
          <img class="example" src="./App6-state.png" />
        </p>
        <p><b>New concept</b>: Updating an item in an array state variable</p>
        <p>
          In React, when updating items in an array state variable, we still
          start by copying the original array, then modifying the item that we
          want to modify by creating an copy of that item. See the code and
          explanations below:
          <img class="example" src="./ConceptUpdateExample.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          • First of all, the example above creates an array called “data” with
          the useState() hook and that array contains items with objects like “{
          id: …, name: “...”, role: “...”}”
        </p>
        <p>
          • Then, on line 10, we defined an “onUpdateData” function where there
          is one parameter “emp” which should have the data for an emp including
          “id”, “name”, and “role”, and two more parameters for “newName” and
          “newRole” to update those fields for the specific emp.
        </p>
        <p>
          • On line 11, the original “data” array is copied using the spread
          operator (the dot-dot-dot …) inside of square brackets.
        </p>
        <p>
          • On line 12, we get the index (position in the array) for the “emp”
          and change that array item to be a copy of the emp data by using
          “…emp”. Also, the name and role are updated to be the values in
          newName and newRole.
        </p>
        <p>
          • On line 13, we use “setData(...)” to update the data array so that
          the next time the app render it will show the list including the
          updated item.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Finally, you can see an example of calling the “onUpdateData”
          function which could be used when submitting a form to edit users
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Back to the todo app…</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          10. <i>(continued)</i> Secondly, we will create a function “onDone”
          that will set a todo item to be done and it will set the completed
          date for that item to be the current date:
          <img class="exampleShort" src="./App6-onDone.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, create a section for “Completed Todos”, and then start filtering
          the “Todos” and “Completed Todos” section by todos that are completed
          or not. Todos that are completed (isDone === true) should go into the
          “Completed Todos” section. Otherwise (isDone === false), they should
          go into the “Todos” section. Also, pass the “onDone” function to the
          Todo component in the return part of App.jsx. We will add the code tor
          the Todo component soon:
          <img class="example" src="./App6-return.png" />
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, update the Todo component code to include the “onDone”
          function as a prop, to show the completed date (if it is defined), and
          to show the “Complete” button if the todo is not completed:
          <img class="exampleShort" src="./Todo2.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          All these changes will look like this in the browser (I completed a
          task to show it below):
          <img class="example" src="./Result4.png" />
        </p>

        <h1>Part 6 - Deleting To-Do Items</h1>
        <p>
          Finally, being able to delete todo items that have already been
          completed will help to increase a user's focus on important things in
          the app. This will involve learning one more concept to deleting items
          from an array state variable:
          <img class="example" src="./ConceptDeleteExample.png" />
        </p>
        <p><b>New concept</b>: Deleting an item in an array state variable</p>
        <p>
          In React, when deleting items in an array state variable, we still
          start by copying the original array, then removing that item from the
          copied array. See the code and explanations below:
        </p>
        <p>
          • First of all, the example above creates an array called “data” with
          the useState() hook and that array contains items with objects like “{
          id: …, name: “...”, role: “...”}”
        </p>
        <p>
          • Then, on line 10, we defined an “onDeleteData” function where there
          is one parameter “emp” which should be the item that we want to delete
          from “data”.
        </p>
        <p>
          • On line 11, the original “data” array is copied using the spread
          operator (the dot-dot-dot …) inside of square brackets.
        </p>
        <p>
          • On line 12, we get the index (position in the array) for the “emp”
          and using the “splice()” function, it will remove the item at that
          position. The second parameter “1” means only one item should be
          removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          • On line 13, we use “setData(...)” to update the data array so that
          the next time the app render it will show the list including the
          updated item.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Finally, you can see an example of calling the “onDeleteData”
          function which could be used when clicking a button to delete a user
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Back to the todo app…</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          11. Now we will create a function “onDelete” that will delete a todo
          item from the “todos” array. Also, we will pass the “onDelete”
          function to the Todo component:
          <img class="example" src="./AppFinal-onDelete.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, in the Todo component we will use the “onDelete” function and
          show a “Delete” button if the todo is already completed/done:
          <img class="example" src="./TodoFinal.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Open your application in a web browser. There will be three to-do
          items displayed. There will also be a delete button for removing
          completed to-do items. I have completed one of the todo items to show
          the different state:
          <img class="example" src="./ResultFinal.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          And that's all it takes to create a simple todo app in React! I hope
          you learned a lot from this tutorial.
