        <h2>How to Create a Simple Todo App</h2>

        <p>
          In this blog post, I will show you how to create a To-do app in React
          with the concepts that I showed from the
          <a href="https://debora-k.github.io">first blog post</a> as well as
          new concepts that will be explained later on.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this To-do app, you will be able to create, display, update, and
          delete todo items. These features will use the "<span
            class="darkYellow"
            >useState</span
          ><span class="brackets">()</span>" hook to keep track of changes to
          the todo list. There will also be dynamic styles used based on whether
          a todo item is done or not done.
        </p>
        <p>
          While writing the different features of the todo app, there will be
          multiple components created for better readability instead of creating
          just a single component (App component which is in the App.jsx file)
          with everything inside of it.
        </p>
        <div class="textbox">
          <p>New concepts that will be learned:</p>
          <p>
            üîπ Using the <span class="darkYellow">map</span> function on an
            array to display items

          <p>üîπ Deleting an item in an array state variable</p>
          <p>
            These concepts will be explained in this blog post as you read
            through.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h1>Part 1: Using create-react-app to setup the app</h1>
        <p>
          1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. Node.js is
          required to use "npx" or "npm" commands. You can download it from
          here:
          <a href="https://nodejs.org/">https://nodejs.org</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Create the react app by opening a terminal an entering this
          command:
        </p>
        <p>npx create-react-app todo-list</p>
        <p>
          3. Open the folder "todo-list" in your code editor (e.g. in VS Code)
          <img class="example" src="part1-openFolder.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          4. To start running the app, open a terminal and run this command:
        </p>
        <p>
          npm start
          <img class="example" src="part1-start.png" />
        </p>
        <h1>Part 2: Adding basic styling</h1>
        <p>
          We will add basic styling so that our app displays the todo items in a
          simple and friendly way.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Open App.css and change the contents to the css below. This styling
          is basic styling used for creating a background for the app, and
          styling for each todo item:

          <img class="example" src="./AppCss.png" />
        </p>
        <h1>Part 3: Showing To-Do Items</h1>
        <p>
          5. Open App.jsx and change the contents to the following code below.
        </p>
        <img class="example" src="./App1.png" />

        <p>
          This code creates a state variable called "<span class="darkBlue"
            >todos</span
          >" that will store the data for all the todo items in an array. There
          is also a function "<span class="darkYellow">setTodos</span>" that is
          used to update the "<span class="darkBlue">todos</span>" variable,
          which includes adding, updating, or deleting items in the array.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the "<span class="darkYellow">useState</span
          ><span class="brackets">()</span>" there are three todo items which
          are being used as fake data so that we can start showing todo items.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember from the first blog post, that "<span class="darkYellow"
            >useState</span
          ><span class="brackets">()</span>" will remember its current value
          when rendering for achieving an interactive user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, this is what the app will look like in the browser, no todo
          items displayed yet!
          <img class="example" src="./Result1.png" />
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          6. Use the <span class="darkYellow">map</span
          ><span class="brackets">()</span> function with the "<span
            class="brightBlue"
            >todos</span
          >" array to display the todo items.
        </p>
        <div class="textbox">
          <p>
            <b>New concept</b>: Using the
            <span class="darkYellow">map</span> function on an array to display
            items
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚ùó‚ùó <i>New concept examples are not related to the todo app.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            In React, one way to show multiple items from an array in the app is
            to use the "<span class="darkYellow">map</span
            ><span class="brackets">()</span>" function. See this example and
            then see the explanation below
            <img class="example" src="./ConceptMapExample.png" />
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ First of all, the example above creates an array called "data"
            with the <span class="darkYellow">useState</span
            ><span class="brackets">()</span> hook and that array contains items
            with objects like "{ <span class="brightBlue">id</span>: ‚Ä¶,
            <span class="brightBlue">name</span>: "...",
            <span class="brightBlue">role</span>: "..."}"
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ Then, on line 11, the "<span class="darkYellow">map</span
            ><span class="brackets">()</span>" function is used on the "data"
            array with an arrow function inside the round brackets like: "(<span
              class="brightBlue"
              >emp</span
            >) =&gt; (‚Ä¶)"
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ The <span class="darkYellow">map</span
            ><span class="brackets">()</span> function will loop through each
            item in the "data" array and call the arrow function each time. The
            result for each item is inside the round brackets after =&gt; which
            is "&lt;div&gt; ‚Ä¶ &lt;/div&gt;"
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ "<span class="brightBlue">emp</span>" is a parameter for an item
            from the "data" array. The <span class="brightBlue">name</span> can
            be changed to whatever you want. For example, the first time the
            <span class="darkYellow">map</span>() function loops,
            <span class="brightBlue">emp</span> will be the value "{
            <span class="brightBlue">id</span>: 10,
            <span class="brightBlue">name</span>: "Alex",
            <span class="brightBlue">role</span>: "Developer" }"
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ To show data from the "<span class="brightBlue">emp</span>"
            parameter, use curly brackets "{<span class="brightBlue">emp</span
            >.<span class="brightBlue">fieldName</span>}" like in the example
            "{<span class="brightBlue">emp</span>.<span class="brightBlue"
              >name</span
            >}" and "{<span class="brightBlue">emp</span>.<span
              class="brightBlue"
              >role</span
            >}"
          </p>
          <img class="example" src="./ConceptMapResult.png" />
        </div>
        <p><i>Back to the todo app‚Ä¶</i></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Now, update the code in the <span class="violet">return</span> ( ‚Ä¶ ) part of the App.jsx file:

          <img class="example" src="./App2.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          In this step, we used "<span class="brightBlue">todos</span>.<span
            class="darkYellow"
            >map</span
          >((todo, index) =&gt; ( ... ))" to display each todo in the "<span
            class="brightBlue"
            >todos</span
          >" array by looping through each todo item to create a div with the
          todo text inside.
        </p>
        <div class="textbox">
          <p>
            <b>New concept</b>: "<span class="brightBlue">key</span>" attribute
            in components / JSX elements
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, we set "<span class="brightBlue">key</span>={index}" because
            React requires that JSX elements that are directly inside of "<span
              class="darkYellow"
              >map</span
            >(...)" have a "<span class="brightBlue">key</span>". As a reminder,
            "JSX elements" include tags like "&lt;div&gt;" or components like
            "&lt;Component /&gt;". React uses the "<span class="brightBlue"
              >key</span
            >" to correctly update the app when items are moved around,
            inserted, or deleted. The <span class="brightBlue">key</span> should
            be unique for an element, such as a unique "id" in data. In our todo
            app, our
            <span class="brightBlue">todos</span>
            do not have an id, so we used the index as the
            <span class="brightBlue">key</span>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The app should look like this now:
          <img class="example" src="./Result2.png" />
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          7. Splitting up the code: We can make the App component smaller by
          creating a Todo component in a separate file and using it in the App
          component like "&lt;Todo ‚Ä¶ /&gt;". See below for the changes to the
          code
        </p>
        <p>
          Making the code for each component smaller is helpful to understand
          each component more easily, without as many details to process at one
          time
        </p>
        <p>
          In new file Todo.jsx in src/ folder:
          <img class="example" src="./Todo1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          In App.jsx, import the new Todo component:
          <img class="exampleShort" src="./App3-import.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Then in App.jsx, use the Todo component in the
          <span class="darkYellow">map</span><span class="gold">()</span>
          function:
          <img class="example" src="./App3-return.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          This step will not change how the app is displayed in the browser, so
          let's move on to the next part.
        </p>

        <h1>Part 4: Adding To-Do Items</h1>

        <p>
          In this part, you will learn how to add new todo items in your app. To
          start out, you will learn about how to add items to an array that was
          created with "<span class="darkYellow">useState</span
          ><span class="brackets">()</span>".
        </p>
        <div class="textbox">
          <p>
            <b>New concept</b>: Adding a new item to an array state variable
          </p>
          <p>
            In React, state variables are set using the "<span
              class="darkYellow"
              >setNAME</span
            ><span class="brackets">()</span>" function from the
            <span class="darkYellow">useState</span>() line: "const [<span
              class="darkBlue"
              >NAME</span
            >, <span class="darkYellow">setNAME</span>] =
            <span class="darkYellow">useState</span>(‚Ä¶);". However, to add an
            item to an array state variable, the original array must be copied,
            then the copied array can be modified. See the code and explanations
            below:

            <img class="example" src="./ConceptAddExample.png" />
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ First of all, the example above creates an array called "<span class="brightBlue">data</span>"
            with the <span class="darkYellow">useState</span>() hook and that
            array contains items with objects like "{
            <span class="brightBlue">id</span>: ‚Ä¶,
            <span class="brightBlue">name</span>: "...",
            <span class="brightBlue">role</span>: "..."}"
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ Then, on line 10, we defined an "onAddData" function where there
            is one parameter "<span class="brightBlue">newEmpData</span>" which should have the <span class="brightBlue">data</span> for an emp
            including "<span class="brightBlue">id</span>", "<span
              class="brightBlue"
              >name</span
            >", and "<span class="brightBlue">role</span>".
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ On line 11, the original "<span class="brightBlue">data</span>" array is copied using the spread
            operator (the dot-dot-dot ‚Ä¶) inside of square brackets.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ On line 12, we add the "<span class="brightBlue">newEmpData</span>" object to the copied array
            "<span class="brightBlue">newData</span>"
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ On line 13, we use "<span class="darkYellow">setData</span>(...)"
            to update the <span class="brightBlue">data</span> array so that the next time the app render it
            will show the list including the newest item.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ Finally, you can see an example of calling the "<span
              class="darkYellow"
              >onAddData</span
            >" function which could be used when submitting a form to add a new
            employee.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p><i>Back to the todo app‚Ä¶</i></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          8. In the App.jsx file, we will add a function "onAddTodo" that will
          have a parameter "value" that will be added as a new todo item:

          <img class="example" src="./App4.png" />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          9. We also will be creating a new component called AddTodoForm that
          will take input for a new todo item. This will use a &lt;form&gt;, so
          we will first learn about how to use form in React to handle form
          submitting:
        </p>
        <div class="textbox">
          <p>
            <b>New concept</b>: Using a form in React and handling the form
            submit
          </p>
          <p>
            In React, a &lt;<span class="darkBlue">form</span>&gt; can be used
            to add new data to an app. There are several parts including
            handling <span class="brightBlue">onSubmit</span>,
            <span class="darkYellow">preventDefault</span
            ><span class="brackets">()</span>, and controlling inputs that will
            be discussed below:
            <img class="exampleWide" src="./ConceptFormExample.png" />
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ First of all, the example above creates an object called "<span class="brightBlue">empData</span>"
            with the <span class="darkYellow">useState</span
            ><span class="brackets">()</span> hook with the fields "<span
              class="brightBlue"
              >name</span
            >" and "<span class="brightBlue">role</span>"
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ Then, on line 6, we defined a "<span class="darkYellow"
              >handleSubmit</span
            >" function where there is one parameter "e" for the event that
            called the "<span class="darkYellow">handleSubmit</span>" function.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ On line 7 we used "e.<span class="darkYellow">preventDefault</span
            ><span class="brackets">()</span>"" to stop the browser from
            refreshing the page after submitting
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ On line 8, there is validation to make sure that the
            <span class="brightBlue">name</span> and
            <span class="brightBlue">role</span>
            are not empty.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ On line 9, we print a message to the browser. This is where the
            new data could be added to a backend, or to an array of employees.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ On line 10, the "<span class="brightBlue">empData</span>" state
            variable is reset back to being empty

          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ On lines 17 and 23, we are controlling the value of the inputs
            depending on the current values in
            <span class="brightBlue">empData</span>. This is what lets us clear
            the inputs after the form is submitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ On Lines 18 and 24, we are using the
            <span class="brightBlue">onChange</span> attribute to update the
            <span class="brightBlue">name</span> and
            <span class="brightBlue">role</span> in the "<span
              class="brightBlue"
              >empData</span
            >" state variable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is the result after submitting:
            <img class="exampleShort" src="./ConceptFormResult.png" />
          </p>
        </div>
        <p><i>Back to the todo app‚Ä¶</i></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          9. <i>(continued)</i> This new component will also use "<span
            class="darkYellow"
            >useState</span
          ><span class="brackets">()</span>" to keep track of what the user
          typed in and then will handle the form submit (e.g. when the user
          presses "enter" in the form, or when the submit button is clicked). It
          will also check that the "<span class="brightBlue">text</span>" for the new todo item is not empty.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a new file "AddTodoForm.jsx" in src/ folder add the following code:
          <img class="exampleWide" src="./AddTodoForm1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, add this new AddTodoForm component to your App component and
          pass the onAddTodo function to the AddTodoForm component
        </p>
        <p>
          In App.jsx, import the new AddTodoForm component:
          <img class="exampleShort" src="./App5-import.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          In App.jsx, use the AddTodoForm component:
          <img class="exampleShort" src="./App5-return.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Open your application in a web browser. You should be able to see the
          original todo list items from the fake data and now a form at the top
          that allows you to add a new todo item:
          <img class="example" src="./Result3.png" />
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Now that you can create todo items, we will move on to being able to
          update items to being completed, and then showing them in a separate
          "completed" todo list.
        </p>

        <h1>Part 5 - Updating To-Do Items</h1>
        <p>
          10. It's time to allow completing items to move then to the
          "completed" section of the todo app. First, we will add more data to
          the <span class="brightBlue">todos</span> array in the App component:
          <img class="example" src="./App6-state.png" />
        </p>
        <div class="textbox">
          <p><b>New concept</b>: Updating an item in an array state variable</p>
          <p>
            In React, when updating items in an array state variable, we still
            start by copying the original array, then modifying the item that we
            want to modify by creating an copy of that item. See the code and
            explanations below:
            <img class="example" src="./ConceptUpdateExample.png" />
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ First of all, the example above creates an array called "data"
            with the <span class="darkYellow">useState</span
            ><span class="brackets">()</span> hook and that array contains items
            with objects like "{ <span class="brightBlue">id</span>: ‚Ä¶,
            <span class="brightBlue">name</span>: "...",
            <span class="brightBlue">role</span>: "..."}"
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ Then, on line 10, we defined an "<span class="darkYellow"
              >onUpdateData</span
            >" function where there is one parameter "<span class="brightBlue"
              >emp</span
            >" which should have the data for an
            <span class="brightBlue">emp</span> including "id", "<span
              class="brightBlue"
              >name</span
            >", and "<span class="brightBlue">role</span>", and two more
            parameters for "newName" and "newRole" to update those fields for
            the specific <span class="brightBlue">emp</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ On line 11, the original "data" array is copied using the spread
            operator (the dot-dot-dot ‚Ä¶) inside of square brackets.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ On line 12, we get the index (position in the array) for the
            "<span class="brightBlue">emp</span>" and change that array item to
            be a copy of the <span class="brightBlue">emp</span> data by using
            "...<span class="brightBlue">emp</span>". Also, the <span class="brightBlue">name</span> and
            <span class="brightBlue">role</span> are updated to be the values in
            newName and newRole.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ On line 13, we use "<span class="darkYellow">setData</span>(...)"
            to update the data array so that the next time the app render it
            will show the list including the updated item.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ Finally, you can see an example of calling the "<span
              class="darkYellow"
              >onUpdateData</span
            >" function which could be used when submitting a form to edit users
          </p>
        </div>
        <p><i>Back to the todo app‚Ä¶</i></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          10. <i>(continued)</i> Secondly, we will create a function "<span
            class="darkYellow"
            >onDone</span
          >" that will set a todo item to be done and it will set the completed
          date for that item to be the current date:
          <img class="exampleShort" src="./App6-onDone.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, create a section for "Completed Todos", and then start filtering
          the "Todos" and "Completed Todos" section by
          <span class="brightBlue">todos</span> that are completed or not. Todos
          that are completed (<span class="brightBlue">todo</span>.<span
            class="brightBlue"
            >isDone</span
          >
          === true) should go into the "Completed Todos" section. Otherwise
          (<span class="brightBlue">todo</span>.<span class="brightBlue"
            >isDone</span
          >
          === false), they should go into the "Todos" section. Also, pass the
          "<span class="darkYellow">onDone</span>" function to the Todo
          component in the <span class="violet">return</span> part of App.jsx. We will add the code tor the
          Todo component soon:
          <img class="example" src="./App6-return.png" />
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, update the Todo component code to include the "<span
            class="darkYellow"
            >onDone</span
          >" function as a prop, to show the completed date (if it is defined),
          and to show the "Complete" button if the todo is not completed:
          <img class="exampleShort" src="./Todo2.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          All these changes will look like this in the browser (I completed a
          task to show it below):
          <img class="example" src="./Result4.png" />
        </p>

        <h1>Part 6 - Deleting To-Do Items</h1>
        <p>
          Finally, being able to delete todo items that have already been
          completed will help to increase a user's focus on important things in
          the app. This will involve learning one more concept to deleting items
          from an array state variable.
        </p>
        <div class="textbox">
          <p><b>New concept</b>: Deleting an item in an array state variable</p>
          <p>
            In React, when deleting items in an array state variable, we still

            <img class="example" src="./ConceptDeleteExample.png" />
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ First of all, the example above creates an array called "data"
            with the <span class="darkYellow">useState</span>() hook and that
            array contains items with objects like "{
            <span class="brightBlue">id</span>: ‚Ä¶,

          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ Then, on line 10, we defined an "<span class="darkYellow"

            >" which should be the item that we want to delete from "data".
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ On line 11, the original "data" array is copied using the spread
            operator (the dot-dot-dot ‚Ä¶) inside of square brackets.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ On line 12, we get the index (position in the array) for the
            "<span class="brightBlue">emp</span>" and using the "<span
              class="darkYellow"
              >splice</span
            >()" function, it will remove the item at that position. The second
            parameter "1" means only one item should be removed.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ On line 13, we use "<span class="darkYellow">setData</span>(...)"
            to update the data array so that the next time the app render it
            will show the list including the updated item.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‚Ä¢ Finally, you can see an example of calling the "<span

              >onDeleteData</span

            user
          </p>
        </div>
        <p><i>Back to the todo app‚Ä¶</i></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          11. Now we will create a function "<span class="darkYellow"
            >onDelete</span
          >" that will delete a todo item from the "<span class="brightBlue"
            >todos</span
          >" array. Also, we will pass the "<span class="darkYellow"
            >onDelete</span
          >" function to the Todo component:
          <img class="example" src="./AppFinal-onDelete.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, in the Todo component we will use the "<span
            class="darkYellow"
            >onDelete</span
          >" function and show a "Delete" button if the todo is already
          completed/done:
          <img class="example" src="./TodoFinal.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Open your application in a web browser. There will be three to-do
          items displayed. There will also be a delete button for removing
          completed to-do items. I have completed one of the todo items to show
          the different state:
          <img class="example" src="./ResultFinal.png" />
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          And that's all it takes to create a simple todo app in React! I hope
          you learned a lot from this tutorial. üòä
